/*
 * 	This should all be done with the thought in mind that this API will be taking inputs from both a GUI and from another program (the AI)
 * 	Nothing should be limited
 * 	We should be able to change the size of the board/ add new pieces
 * 	The AI and the GUI should be easily integratabel into the API
 * 	This should be easily upscaled to a web-based app
 * 
 * 
 * 			/////CHESS PIECES/////
 * 
 * 1.) Create classes for each chess piece
 * 
 * 2.) Create valid move methods for each piece
 *		-these should returns a 2-d array list of every possible move
 * 3.)
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 	
 * 		///////CHESS BOARD//////
 * 
 * 1.) Create method that tests and executes moves
 * 		-this method should intakes two inputs, the x,y of the piece being moved, and the x,y it is being moved to
 * 		-this method should  run the "isValidMove" method of which ever peice has been clicked, if that yeilds true, then move the piece
 * 
 *  2.) Create a method that tests for checkmate and stalemate
 *  
 *  3.) 
 *
 *
 *
 *		/////CHESS GUI/////
 *
 * 1.) Create a GUI that simply displays the current board
 *		-no calculations should be don in the GUI
 *		-the GUI simply detects what JButton the user has clicked then feeds feeds this move to the API
 *		-if the move is valid the GUI updates to the current board state
 *		-if not the the clicked JButton should flash red 
 *
 *
 *		////CHESS AI/////
 *
 * 1.) marcov chains
 * 
 * 		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model
 * 		//Basin approach (better to say)
 * 
 * 
 * 2.) Decision trees (binary search tree)
 * 		"Decision tree implementation"
 * 
 *		//enumerate through every move
 *		//rank each move off heuristics
 *		//make move
 *
 *		
 *	3.) neural net
 *		MAIN ONE, might be hard
 *		My First Neural Net
